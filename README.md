# GithubStoryProject
A story built by the readers.

This project is based on the concept of a chose your own adventure book.
Instead of choosing a choice, however, you write your own story.

The story wil be sorted into chapters. When you submit your addition, label it with the chapter number it should be.
I will attempt to review submissions at least once a week, but no guarantees.

# Submision
Submissions will be made by using Github's pull request feature. To do so, you first must fork the repo.
This will give you the most up-to-date version.
Next, make your addition, checking for any mistakes.
Finaly, create a pull request, and I will eventualy review it. 

# Rules
The story must relate to the previous chapter written.

For example, if the charater has just been teleported to another dimension, they cannot randomly appear back at home.
This is a general rule, but important to avoid the story from disintegrating into random nothingness.

This story should be rated Teen or below. No random swearing, and no lemons.

**Please.**
