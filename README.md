# GithubStoryProject
A story built by the readers.

This project is based on the concept of a chose your own adventure book.
Instead of choosing a choice, however, you write your own story.



The story wil be sorted into chapters. When you submit your addition, label it with the chapter number it should be.
I will attempt to review submissions at least once a week, but no guarantees.

# Submision

# Rules
The story must relate to the previous chapter written.

For example, if the charater has just been teleoprted to another dimension, they cannot appear back at home.
This is a general rule, but important to avoid the story from disintegration into random nothingness.

This story should be rated Teen or below. No random swearing, and no lemons.

**Please.**
