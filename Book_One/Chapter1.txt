In the land of (LANDNAME), there are... diffrences to our world.
Our world, focuses on electricity.
Our world, lives in large cities.
Our world, does not use magic.
In this land, however, each being has some innate ability to controll the passing of magic through their body.
Some, are strong, considered mages.
Others, are not, and simply go about thier daily lives.
Our story, however, is about the adventures of two orphans, brother and sister, as they decide to see what there is to see.

"Sophie, wait up for a sec!" yelled Brandon as he stopped for a rest.

Sophia, his sister, turned around after walking a few more paces.

"What is it, another rock?" Sophia asked,with a smile.

"That was an intresting sight, you must admit. But no. I'm tired, and so are you. You just wanted me to say so first."

Sophia smirked.

"So? You still did."

"Yeah, because you would have collapsed before you said anything. Sheesh." Brandon replied, walking over to a fallen log he spotted.
As he sat, he glanced at their srroundings. They were in a forest, on a well worn path.
The two suns were barely visible, as the foliage was thick above their heads, and light, fluffy clouds as well.
The path they were on had been winding back and forth for a while, but the map Sophia had on hand was definite about the path.

"Scoot over, I need some space too," Sophia responds, walking over to the log.
She sat down, also glancing around.
